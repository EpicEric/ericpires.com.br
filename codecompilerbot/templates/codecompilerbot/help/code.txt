/code - Displays the current code for this session, if any. If no language has been selected yet, it will prompt you to choose one first.

/code default - Replaces the current code with a default "Hello World" program for the appropriate language.

/code <code> - Replaces the current code with the text in <code>. For indentation-enforced languages, use spaces (sorry :<). Markdown such as monospace font does not affect code and will be ignored.
